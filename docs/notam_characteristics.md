1) What a NOTAM is:

A NOTAM is a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations but not known far enough in advance to  be publicized by other means

2) ICAO NOTAM Format

NOTAM number, type
    Q) qualifier line
    A) location
    B) start time
    C) end time
    D) schedule (optional)
    E) NOTAM text
    F) Lower altitude limit
    G) Upper altitude limit

3) Q-line

Example:
Q) KZAU/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/4159N08754W005

4) Flight Information Region (FIR)

The ICAO location indicator of the FIR in which the subject of the NOTAM is geographically located

Albuquerque KZAB    
Atlanta KZTL
Anchorage PAZA
Boston KZBW
Chicago KZAU
Cleveland KZOB
Denver KZDV
Fort Worth KZFW
Guam PGZU
Honolulu PHZH
Houston KZHU
Indianapolis KZID
Jacksonville KDJX
Kansas City KZKC
Los Angeles KZLA
Memphis KZME
Miami KZMA
Minneapolis KZMP
New York KZNY
Oakland KZOA
Salt Lake KZLC
San Juan TJZS
Seattle KZSE
Washington KZDC
New York Oceanic KZWY
Oakland Oceanic KZAK

5) NOTAM code

 - All NOTAM code groups contain a total of five letters.
 - The first letter is always the letter Q. The second and third letters identify the subject, and the fourth and fifth letters denote the condition of the subject being reported. Ex: QMRLC 
 - Used to form how NOTAM qualifiers TRAFFIC, PURPOSE, and SCOPE are determined for inclusion in Q) NOTAM format.

6) Traffic

Relates the NOTAM to a type of traffic and allows retrieval according to the user's needs

    I) Instrument Flight Rules
    V) Visual Flight Rules
    K) Checklist

7) Purpose

Relates a NOTAM to a certain purpose and allows for retrieval 

 - N NOTAM selected for the immediate attention of aircraft
operators
 - B NOTAM selected for pre-flight information briefing
 - O NOTAM concerning flight operations
 - M Miscellaneous NOTAM; not subject for briefing, but is
available on request
 - K NOTAM is a Checklist

8) Scope

Used to categorize NOTAMs by the operational area affected

 - A Aerodrome
 - E Enroute
 - W Navigation warning 
 - K Checklist

9) Lower and Upper

 - Lower and upper limit fields apply mostly to airspace related NOTAMs but not only them. Ex: 000 lower and 999 upper

Coordinates/Radius

 - Coordinates that represent the center of the area of influence Ex: 4159N08754W005
}

10) Location

    A) Is the ICAO location indicator of the aerodome or for FIR where the facility, airspace, or condition being reported is located

 - Only one aerodome designator must be entered in A)
 - Activity must take place within 5 miles of the airport reference point and the condition must have direct impact on local operations.

11) From and To

    B) The date and time that the activity or condition described in the NOTAM begins

    C) Marks the time the NOTAM expires

 - All times are designated in UTC
 - The duration of a NOTAM should not exceed three months (90 days)
 - A NOTAM will expire at a specified time if not replaced or cancelled before expiration

12) Schedule

 - D is an optional field and indicates if the hazard, state of operation or condition will be active between the dates and times of items B) and C) to insert into D)

EXC – For designating a full day or a series of full
days when the NOTAM is NOT active.
SR – If appropriate, to indicate sunrise.
SS – If appropriate, to indicate sunset.
H24 – For the whole day/dates concerned. Not to be

    E) The condition in which the NOTAM is being issued or made active. The text must be kept brief, yet contain all essential information needed to accurately convey the changes in condition.

14) NOTAM upper and lower limits

 - Surface (SFC)
 - An altitude in feet
 - A flight level
 - (UNL) used to describe an unlimited upper limit.

15) Type 

 - NOTAMN (New)
 - NOTAMR (Replaces a previous NOTAM)
 - NOTAMC (Cancels a previous NOTAM)

16) Number

 - The first letter is the NOTAM series
 - The next four numbers are sequential
 - The last 2 numbers represent the year

Example NOTAM:

B0667/21 NOTAMN
Q) KZAU/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/4159N08754W005
A) KORD <Location>
B) 2106231700 <From>
C) 2106232300 <To>
D) <Schedule>
E) RWY 04L/22R CLSD
F) 000<Lower Limit>
G) 999<Upper Limit>
